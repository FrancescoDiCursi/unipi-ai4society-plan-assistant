# Do you want to help?

This extension is an amatourish product made in order to practice my skills and to help others. **I do not have the time to carefully style it** (i.e., it seems to come straight from 2000 üôà).

**If you are a designer, or you are passionate about styling digital products, contact me here on github in the "Issues" section in order to suggest a more appealing style**.

 Any help would be appreciated ü§ô
